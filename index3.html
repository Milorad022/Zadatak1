<p>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed
        closely on the pioneering work of the<br> English physicist and mathematician Oliver 
        Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. The importance of
         the patent was made clear when the American<br> rights to it were acquired by American
          Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's
           patent, they made little use of it, as they <br>already had their own development
            in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging Pupin
             with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they<br> would lose control of an
              invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend
               the range of long distance telephones and especially<br> submarine ones.</p>
